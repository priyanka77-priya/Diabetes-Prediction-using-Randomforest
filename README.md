What is Diabetes?

Diabetes is a metabolic disease that causes high blood sugar. The hormone insulin moves sugar from the blood into your cells to be stored or used for energy. With diabetes, your body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't effectively use the insulin it does make.

Where is this data from?
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to dianostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on
certain diagnostic measaurements included in the dataset. Several contraints were places on the selection of these instance from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years
old of Pima Indian heritage.




Pregnancies: The number of times the candidate has been pregnant. This can be categorized as normal (0-4 pregnancies) or overpregnancies (>4 pregnancies).

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration measured 2 hours after an oral glucose tolerance test. It is categorized as low (<70), normal (70-99), high (99-126), or very high (>126).

Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure level in mm/Hg. It is categorized as normal (<80) or risky (>80).

Skin Thickness: Triceps skinfold thickness in mm. It is categorized as normal (<30) or high fat (>= 70).

Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin level in muU/ml.

BMI (Body Mass Index): Calculated as weight in kg divided by (height in m)^2. It is categorized as underweight (<18.5), normal (18.5-25), overweight (25-30), or obese (>30).

Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.

Age: Age of the patient in years.

Outcome: Class variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes or not (0 or 1). Out of 768 instances, 268 are labeled as 1 (indicating diabetes) and the others are labeled as 0 (indicating no diabetes
